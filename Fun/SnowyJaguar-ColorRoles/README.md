# Color Roles
This action lets you list roles, assign and remove them to/from yourself. This action includes four subcommands and one reference from a native Atlas command.

## Setup
There are a few parts of this action command that you need to setup before you can use it.

1. You need to create some color roles, if not already created.  
2. Replace `NUMBER` in `{set;roles_amount;NUMBER}` to the number of color roles you just created.
3. Change `COLOR_ROLE_ID` in `{set;1;COLOR_ROLE_ID}` to the ID of your color role.\
   You can add more roles by copy pasting the `{set;1}` tag and replacing them with numbers `2`, `3`, `etc...`
4. If you already added (or removed) a color role, you would need to ament the first `{if}` statement and add in `2` and do the same for our `{role.mention;{get;2}}` tag.
5. Congrats! you have your color role action all set up ðŸŽ‰.

## Optional
You can remove Use `{guild.prefix}color help` to get help with this action if you do not wnat to be told how to bring up the help menu evey time you use `a!color` (which would be everytime you use one of the subcommands).
